An updated version of PG SDVX's https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2686833015 for https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/.

Click on Raw in the upper-right of a .js file you want to use, then copy that URL and type `wget <url> <nameYouWantItAs>.js` into you in-game terminal.
For example:

``` console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mycroftjr/BitburnerAutoFarm/master/dist/wgetAll.js wgetAll.js
```
Then, simply `run wgetAll.js`, wait a bit, then `run autoFarm.js` and enjoy!

# Some called scripts not included (I recommend getting them, but nothing should crash without them!):
